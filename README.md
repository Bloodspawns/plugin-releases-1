## Spawn Predictor

<details>
    <summary>Plugin Features</summary>
    
```diff
- Lobby Rotation Information 
Displays the ongoing rotation for that time, and the upcoming rotation in x amount of time
- Display Current Wave
- Display Next Wave
```

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Plugin Changelog</summary>
    
```diff
+ 10/30/2020 - Temporarily added the 'Both' option to the 'Display Mode'
+ 10/30/2020 - Added a new feature to display the CURRENT wave as well the NEXT wave while you have NEXT wave display mode selected
+ 10/30/2020 - Hotkey to toggle the above feature and to select whether to toggle or flash
+ 10/30/2020 - I did some cleaning up of the plugin as well
+ 10/31/2020 - Removed the spam log.debug
```

</details>

**Notes**
- All of these features are automatic, you don't need to press any buttons or anything. 
- The plugin determines rotation on entrance and builds the entire fight caves before the first wave starts. 
- The ground markers are unique to the NPCs size & name, and they will update locations to the right spawn points every wave as they should.

**Known Issues**
- I will work on a solution to fix the jumbled up mess with overlays when you are displaying current and next wave.

> **Note:**

> Only works when there is 4 phases including the head phase

> If you're late into the Olm room the timer will be off (This is for teams only & If you use de0s plugins you'll know about this issue)

> If you end up dying in the Olm room the counter will be split into two chat messages for that corresponding phase. You will get one when you die showing how long you were alive for during that phase and one when the phase ends (If this happens the timer **can** occasionally be off no clue why). Pretty hard to combat this because of how RuneLite deals with NPCs and GameObjects, so if it happens just do some simple math and you'll be fine... or... just don't die
