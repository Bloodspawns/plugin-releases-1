## Spawn Predictor

<details>
    <summary>Plugin Features</summary>
    
```diff
- Lobby Rotation Information 
Displays the ongoing rotation for that time, and the upcoming rotation in x amount of time
- Display Current Wave
- Display Next Wave
```

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Plugin Changelog</summary>
    
```diff
+ 10/30/2020 - Temporarily added the 'Both' option to the 'Display Mode'
+ 10/30/2020 - Added a new feature to display the CURRENT wave as well the NEXT wave while you have NEXT wave display mode selected
+ 10/30/2020 - Hotkey to toggle the above feature and to select whether to toggle or flash
+ 10/30/2020 - I did some cleaning up of the plugin as well
+ 10/31/2020 - Removed the spam log.debug
```

</details>

**Notes**
- All of these features are automatic, you don't need to press any buttons or anything. 
- The plugin determines rotation on entrance and builds the entire fight caves before the first wave starts. 
- The ground markers are unique to the NPCs size & name, and they will update locations to the right spawn points every wave as they should.

**Known Issues**
- I will work on a solution to fix the jumbled up mess with overlays when you are displaying current and next wave.

> Note: This was just to keep consistency between most of the plugins I made, and that can be ran side-by-side with other plugins of the same type.

+ 12/7/2020 - Restructured the entire config
> Note: Re-enable a majority of the plugin as their 'keyName' was changed to make my life easier.

> Note: Fixed a majority of the descriptions to give more accurate information

+ 12/7/2020 - Optimized the entire core of collecting and updating totems, their status, and hp
> Note: This should help out with frame issues as well, previous way was updating/refreshing when it shouldn't and at high speeds.

+ 12/7/2020 - Fixed errors occuring during the start of the fight with 'Prayer Marker'
+ 12/7/2020 - Added 'Contribution' Tracker
+ 12/7/2020 - Added 'Grasping Claws Tick Counter'

## Zulrah

**Thank you to all the people that helped me make this plugin possible. @Damen, @Caps Lock, @McNeil for helping me figure out a solution to dealing with resets, and to the original Zulrah plugin creators for giving something to work off of.**

> **Note:**

> Only works when there is 4 phases including the head phase

> If you're late into the Olm room the timer will be off (This is for teams only & If you use de0s plugins you'll know about this issue)

> If you end up dying in the Olm room the counter will be split into two chat messages for that corresponding phase. You will get one when you die showing how long you were alive for during that phase and one when the phase ends (If this happens the timer **can** occasionally be off no clue why). Pretty hard to combat this because of how RuneLite deals with NPCs and GameObjects, so if it happens just do some simple math and you'll be fine... or... just don't die
